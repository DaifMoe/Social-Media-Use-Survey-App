# Social Media Use Survey App

A new Flutter project for my CSCI 345 (Mobile App Development) class. This 
app surveys the user by asking questions about their social media use and habits.
Depending on the user's answers to the questions asked the app will yield different results.
For example: if a user answers that they use social media often and several hours a day then 
the app will return some advice telling them to take a break or use social media less often.
If they aren't using social media too frequently they are told to keep up their good habits.
